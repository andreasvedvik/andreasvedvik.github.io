    <h2 style="border: none; text-align: center; font-size: 22px; margin-bottom: 8px;">Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p class="effective-date">Effective: February 12, 2026</p>
    <div class="summary-box"><p>Little Marks is a private family app. We collect only what&rsquo;s needed to preserve your child&rsquo;s growth moments. We don&rsquo;t sell your data, show ads, or share anything with third parties. Your family&rsquo;s memories belong to you.</p></div>
    <h2>What We Collect</h2>
    <p>When you use Little Marks, we collect and store the following information to provide the app&rsquo;s core functionality:</p>
    <table class="data-table">
      <tr><th>Data Type</th><th>What &amp; Why</th></tr>
      <tr><td>Account info</td><td>Your email address and display name, used for authentication and account recovery.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Child profiles</td><td>Your child&rsquo;s name, date of birth, and an emoji or avatar you choose. Used to calculate age and organize marks by child.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Voice recordings</td><td>Audio clips (up to 60 seconds) that you record of your child. Stored securely in the cloud.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Photos &amp; handwriting</td><td>Images you capture of your child&rsquo;s handwriting, drawings, or milestone photos. Stored securely in the cloud.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Height measurements</td><td>Height values you enter manually, in centimeters or inches.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Text entries</td><td>Your child&rsquo;s answers to questions, milestone descriptions, and captions you add to marks.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>App preferences</td><td>Your chosen height unit (cm/in), reminder frequency, and language preference.</td></tr>
    </table>
    <h2>How We Store Your Data</h2>
    <p>Your data is stored using Supabase, a secure cloud platform. All data is encrypted in transit (TLS) and at rest. Media files (audio and images) are stored in private, user-scoped storage buckets. Database access is protected by row-level security policies, ensuring you can only access your own family&rsquo;s data.</p>
    <p>A local copy of your data is also kept on your device for offline access. This means you can create marks even without an internet connection &mdash; they&rsquo;ll sync to the cloud when you&rsquo;re back online.</p>
    <h2>What We Don&rsquo;t Do</h2>
    <p>We believe your family&rsquo;s memories deserve complete privacy. Little Marks does not: sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties; display advertisements of any kind; use tracking pixels, analytics SDKs that share data with third parties, or fingerprinting; create profiles of your children for marketing purposes; or allow any external access to your recordings, photos, or personal information.</p>
    <h2>Children&rsquo;s Privacy &amp; COPPA Compliance</h2>
    <p>Little Marks is designed exclusively for use by parents and legal guardians to record information about their children&rsquo;s growth and development. Children are not the intended users of this app.</p>
    <p>We do not knowingly collect personal information directly from children under the age of 13 (or the applicable age in your jurisdiction). Only parents or legal guardians may create accounts, operate the app, and enter information about their children. Children cannot create accounts, interact with the app independently, or provide personal information to us.</p>
    <p>By creating a child profile and entering information about your child, you, as the parent or legal guardian, provide verifiable parental consent for the collection and storage of that information within the app for your private family use.</p>
    <p><strong>Parental rights under COPPA:</strong> As a parent or guardian, you have the right to: review all personal information collected about your child by accessing it within the app or requesting a data export; request deletion of your child&rsquo;s personal information at any time by deleting the child profile within the app or deleting your account entirely; refuse further collection of your child&rsquo;s information by removing their profile or deleting your account. All of these actions can be performed directly within the app&rsquo;s Settings screen.</p>
    <p>If you believe we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under 13 without proper parental consent, please contact us immediately at <a href="mailto:hello@littlemarks.app">hello@littlemarks.app</a> and we will promptly delete the information.</p>
    <h2>Data Retention &amp; Deletion</h2>
    <p>Your data is retained as long as your account is active. The whole point of Little Marks is to preserve memories over years &mdash; we won&rsquo;t delete your data unless you ask us to.</p>
    <p>You can delete your account and all associated data (including all marks, media files, child profiles, and sharing records) directly from the app&rsquo;s Settings screen. Account deletion is immediate and permanent &mdash; all data is removed from our servers and cannot be recovered.</p>
    <p>You can also delete individual child profiles and their associated marks from within the app at any time.</p>
    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal data at any time. You can export all your marks and associated data directly from the app (Settings &rarr; Export Data). If you&rsquo;re in the EU, you have additional rights under GDPR including data portability (Article 20) and the right to be forgotten (Article 17). To exercise these rights, use the in-app export and deletion features or contact us at the email below.</p>
    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>If we make meaningful changes to this privacy policy, we&rsquo;ll notify you through the app or by email before the changes take effect. Minor clarifications or formatting changes won&rsquo;t trigger a notification.</p>
    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy or your data, reach out to us at:</p>
